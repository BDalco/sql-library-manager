# sql-library-manager

This is an application for a local library to help them manage their collection of books. The librarian has been using a simple SQLite database and has been entering data manually. This application provides a more intuitive way to manage the library's collection of books. In this project, I built a web application that will include pages to list, add, update, and delete books. I implemented a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, SQLite and the SQL ORM Sequelize.
